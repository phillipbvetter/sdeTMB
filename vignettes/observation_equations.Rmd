```{r, include=FALSE}
library(sdeTMB)
```

In this document we show how to apply functions to the left-hand side of an observation equation.

```{r}
# Create model object
obj = sdeTMB$new()

# Set name of model (and the created .cpp file)
obj$set_modelname("ornstein_uhlenbeck")

# Add system equations
obj$add_systems(
  dx ~ theta * (mu-x) * dt + sigma_x*dw
)
```

# Adding observation equations

---

Let's assume that our observations $y_{t}$ are log-normally distributed conditioned on $x_{t}$ i.e.
$$
\log y_{t_{i}} \sim \mathcal{N}(x_{t_{i}},\sigma_{y}^{2})
$$
It is sufficient for the user to provide the data column `y` in the provided `data.frame` to e.g. `estimate` or `predict` by adding the following observation equation

```{r}
obj$add_observations(
  log(y) ~ x, obsnames = "log_y"
)
```

Note that these kind of observation equations, where the left-hand side is a function of one (or more) observed variables must be explicitly named using the `obsnames` argument.

# Adding observation variances

---

The names given with `obsnames` are important because they are needed to specify the observation variance. As an example the code below does not work, because the observation was named `log_y`

```{r, error=TRUE}
obj$add_observation_variances(
  y ~ sigma_y^2
)
```
So the correct way to add the observation variance is this:
```{r}
obj$add_observation_variances(
  log_y ~ sigma_y^2
)
```

# Multiple observation equations

---

You must supply multiple `obsnames` if you are supplying multiple observatin equations, although the name will only be used if the left-hand side is not just a single variable i.e.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
obj$add_observations(
  log(y) ~ x,
  y ~ x,
  y^2+z^3 ~ x,
  obsnames = c("log_y", NA, "y2_plus_z3")
)
```
