\usage{
set_initial_state(initial.state, estimate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial.state}{a named list of two entries 'x0' and 'p0' containing the initial state and covariance of the state}

\item{estimate}{boolean value which indicates whether or not the initial conditions
shall be estimated as fixed effects parameters. The provided mean and covariance are then
used as initial guesses}
